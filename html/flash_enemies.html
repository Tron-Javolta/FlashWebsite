		<p style="padding: 1%;">As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter 
		by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. 
		It was at this time that he developed the Captain Boomerang persona that he would 
		continue to use in his later criminal career. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful 
		Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

		<p style="padding: 1%;">Growing up with an abusive father, Leonard Snart took refuge with his grandfather. This was 
		short lived, as his grandfather passed and Snart ended up back with his father. Growing tired of
		the abuse, Snart set out to become a small-time criminal, immediately being captured by The Flash.
		With this, Snart developed a desire to beat The Flash, designing a weapon to harness the power of 
		absolute zero temperatures and stopping The Flash in his tracks. Breaking into a cyclotron lab,
		Snart discovered the true potential of his weapon design with the energy emissions of a cyclotron.
		At that point, Snart donned the name Captain Cold, the man who mastered absolute zero.</p>

		<h1><a id="reverseId">Reverse Flash</a></h1>
		<p style="float: left;"><img src="../images/reverseflash.jpg" rel="reversepic" id="reversepic1" style="width: 370px; height: auto;" /></p>
		<p style="padding: 1%;">Eobard Thawne, a.k.a. Reverse-Flash/Professor Zoom, has gone through various origins
		due to the changing of the timeline, with an extensive background. His most recent origin has been reverted to a previous
		one infact. Eobard was born in the 25th century, where his parents genetically engineered him 
		to be a highly intelligent individual. As he grew up though, he became reclusive and lost in 
		his own head, which was looked down upon in his time period. Everything during the 25th century 
		was set as orderly as possible right down to the second, no matter what was scheduled. Eobard's
		parents had a second son, Robern, to possibly help Eobard with his lack of social skills and 
		responsibilities. This inevitably lead to Eobard falling behind in studies helping his little
		brother, constantly being reprimanded by their parents. Being sidetracked with Robern also lead
		to Eobard being rejected for applying to the Flash Museum in the near future. Eobard attempted breaking
		into the Museum to further his studies, but was quickly caught by his little brother, who at the
		time became a cop. With this incident, a future version of Eobard traveled to the past to stop
		Robern from ever being born, allowing present-day Eobard to continue his studies on Flash and 
		the Speed Force. Successfully admitted to the Flash Museum now, Eobard wanted to collaborate with
		a scientist who could prove the existence of the Speed Force. This scientist refused to collaborate
		with Eobard, leading to another instance of a future version of Eobard changing the timeline by
		killing this scientist. His future self also lead him to discovering the time capsule containing Barry's
		costume to make himself the Flash of the 25th century, setting in motion the events of Eobard being
		rejected as The Flash in the 25th century, and time traveling to The Flash's time period, only to 
		discover that he would become Flash's archnemesis. Through self-fulfilling prophecy in realizing
		Eobard would become Flash's archnemesis, he became mad. Given that if Eobard went to the past to 
		kill Barry or stop his powers from ever happening would cause Eobard to cease being who he is, Eobard
		instead caused every misfortune throughout Barry's childhood, even killing Barry's mother.</p>

		<p style="padding:1%;">Gorilla Grodd hails from a secret society of hyper-intelligent apes in Africa.
		This tribe of apes were originally ordinary apes until a radioactive meteor crashed
		into their home, giving them intelligence, and Grodd powers. After some time, With Barry's 
		speed, he was able to vibrate himself into the dimension of Gorilla City, the secret society of 
		apes. During this incident of stranding himself in Gorilla City, Grodd was in battle with his
		father, who was the king, and eventually wins this battle. As are customs with the gorilla tribe,
		Grodd eats his father's brain to gain his knowledge and become the king himself. Realizing that
		a speedster is within their tribe, the tribe hails Flash as a prophetic messenger, while Grodd
		sees him as a threat to his plot for world conquest. As king, Grodd led out an execution detail
		to kill Barry, but Barry foils these attempts, knocking Grodd unconscious and finally escaping
		Gorilla City. With this, Grodd made it his mission to obtain Barry's Speed Force by consuming him
		to ascend and fulfill his world domination plot.</p>

		Cold's sister.</p>
