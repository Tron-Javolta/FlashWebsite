	<h1>The Flash Timeline<br><br>Pre-Crisis</h1>
	<h3>Flash of Two Worlds</h3>
	<p>While performing speedy tricks for children at a charity event, Barry Allen finds himself
	accidentally vibrating so fast that he transports himself to a parallel Earth. On this earth, 
	Jay Garrick is the Flash in retirement. This story laid the ground work for annual crossovers 
	between the two Earths, as well as the multiverse as a whole.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths and Post-Crisis</h1>
	<h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3>
	<p>With the conflicting stories of DC Comics, there was no real explanation for why there were
	different people as the same hero or different origins or stories in general. Crisis on Infinite
	Earths finally settled this conundrum explaining that the DCU is a multiverse with alternative 
	versions of many different superheroes. The general synopsis of this story is that these parallel
	worlds begun to get eaten by an evil entity, with Barry Allen stopping an attempt to destroy his earth
	and four others, killing Barry Allen. With this, the five earths emerged as one, combining the characters
	from each, and the mantle of the Flash being passed down to Wally West I.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>The Flash: Dead Heat</h3>
	<p>One of our first major events with Wally West I as the Flash, a villain called Savitar attempts to take
	hold of the Speed Force, effectively stealing the speed of the current speedsters like Jessie Quick and Impulse.
	Wally West I discovers this newfound villain, racing to protect his allies in one of his toughest fights yet.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>The Flash: Chain Lightning</h3>
	<p>In this event, Barry Allen's secret twin brother is discovered to be Cobalt Blue, a villain with a severe
	hatred for the Flash. With Wally West I still as the Flash and Barry Allen lost due to Crisis on Infinite Earths,
	he gathers all of the speedsters to spread across time to catch Cobalt Blue. In doing so, Wally West I discovers
	Barry Allen in the 30th century, where Cobalt Blue is attempting and succeeding in a distracted Barry Allen. The 
	sequence of events in this story technically take place before Crisis on Infinite Earths. This means that with Barry
	Allen dead, Wally West I attempts to fill his role as the Flash in stopping the Crisis on Infinite Earths, but realizes
	the differences in each other's power. With this, Wally West I runs back in time (still in the 30th century, yes it is 
	confusing) to save Barry from being killed, only to die saving the five earths in Crisis on Infinite Earths.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Infinite Crisis</h3>
	<p>In regards to Barry Allen, near the end of this arc it is revealed that Barry Allen didn't actually die in Crisis
	on Infinite Earths, but instead was stuck in the Speed Force.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Flashpoint</h3>
	<p>A huge turning point in the continuity of DC Comics, Flashpoint is a very severe incident of the butterfly
	effect when tampering with the past. In Flashpoint, Barry Allen is back, and with all of his troubles piling up on
	him, all he wants is to have his mother back. In what the Reverse-Flash proclaims as a selfish act, Barry Allen, without
	realizing it, runs back in time preventing his mother's death. In doing so, the Earth is completely changed. The Justice League
	was never formed, Superman landed in Metropolis instead of Smallville, becoming a test subject, Bruce Wayne being shot instead
	of his parents, and many many other alternatives. With this alternative Earth as well, Aquaman and Wonder Woman are on the brink
	of war, with no one able to stop them. Barry Allen wakes up in this world, realizing he doesn't have his speed anymore, but has
	his mother. Seeking out the Batman of this alternate version of Earth, which is Bruce's father, to make sense of what's going on,
	Barry discovers just how bad off the world is without the Justice League and how much of an impact his mother's death had on the world.
	With Reverse-Flash taunting him every step of the way, goes back in time to stop himself from saving his mother, but not without the cost
	of still changing many origins and things in his timeline, kicking off the New 52 series.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Post-Flashpoint</h1>
	<h3>Darkseid War</h3>
	<p>During a war to end all wars with the Justice League against Darkseid, the Flash is unfortunate enough to become the God of Death.
	Through a literal race with death, the Flash is tricked into becoming Death, effectively taking him out of the fight, having the urge
	to persue those on the brink of death. After the end of this arc though, he's finally freed from the burden of Death.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Post-DC Rebirth</h1>
	<h3>Batman/The Flash: The Button</h3>
	<p>A tie-in between the DCU and Watchmen, Dr. Manhattan invades the DCU changing small things throughout the history of the universe,
	as well as combining other things like superhero origins new and old. The Flash and Batman discover the small smiley face button from 
	Watchmen within the batcave, setting up for the currently running arc Doomsday Clock on this mash-up.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Force Quest</h3>
	<p>Another ongoing arc, the Force Quest follows Barry Allen on an adventure to discover the origins and abilities of the other forces,
	Strength Force, Sage Force, and the Still Force. Receive updates to find out as the story progresses!</p>
