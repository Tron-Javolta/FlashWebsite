	<h1><a id="jayId">Jay Garrick</a></h1>
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="jayflash.jpg" id="jayflash"/></p>
	<p style="padding: 1%;">Originally, Jay Garrick received his super speed through inhaling hard water vapors in his
	laboratory, later on changing to receiving his super speed from the god Mercury. In the original 
	iteration, Jay is a college student in the 1930's who took a break in his laboratory, ending up 
	inhaling hard water vapors. Realizing his newfound powers, he dons a red shirt with a lightning
	bolt on it and his father's helmet from World War 1. This helmet was based off of the god Mercury,
	which was one of the reasons for the retcon later on. In 1961, Barry Allen vibrates himself to Earth-2,
	home of Jay Garrick Flash, in which they team up to fight crime, and it's the first time interdimensional
	travel occurs.</p>

	<p style="float: left;"><img src="wally1flash.jpg" id="wally1header"/></p>
	<p style="padding: 1%;">Introduced in 1959, Wally West is the nephew of Barry's girlfriend and later wife, Iris West. As a kid,
	his relationship with his parents was poor, hanging out with Iris as much as he could. This allowed Barry
	and Wally to meet, leading to the same accident that happened to Barry to happen to Wally. With this, Wally
	helped Barry fight crime as his sidekick Kid Flash up until the disappearance of Barry in Crisis on Infinite
	Earths, leading to Wally donning the mantle of The Flash. It is later discovered that Wally is the fastest
	speedster through the Flash War arc, putting to rest the debate on the fastest speedster out there. As of the
	Heroes in Crisis story arc though, Wally West has been found deceased in the superhero rehabilitation facility
	called Sanctuary.

	<h1><a id="west2Id">Wally West II</a></h1>
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="wally2flash.jpg" id="wally2header"/></p>
	<p style="padding: 1%;">With the removal of Wally West I from continuity following the New 52 reboot in 2011, Wally West II took his
	place. Iris's other brother, Daniel West, New 52's Reverse-Flash, was Wally West II's father rather than Rudy,
	Wally West I's original father. Barry and Wally II meet up the same way Barry met Wally I, through Iris. Instead of being covered in
	electrically charged chemicals from a lightning strike in Barry's lab though, Wally II is simply struck by lightning. Throughout the
	New 52 series, Wally West II remains Flash's sidekick while Wally West I is trapped in the Speed Force due to Barry altering the timeline
	in Flashpoint by going back in time and saving his mother from death.</p>

	<h1><a id="bartId">Bart Allen</a></h1>
	<p style="float: left;"><img src="bartimage.jpg"/></p>
	<p style="padding: 1%;">Hailing from the future, Bart Allen is the grandson of Barry Allen. Imbued at birth with the Speed Force in him, he suffers from
	hyper-accelerated metabolism. This causes Bart to age much faster than normal, appearing 12 when he was two years old. To keep from 
	developing further problems, Bart was raised in a virtual reality machine to simulate a world at his own scale of time. Noticing that 
	this virtual reality wasn't helping, his grandmother, Iris Allen, sent him to the present where Barry and Wally I zapped his metabolism
	to a normal rate through a race around the world. Being too much to handle for Wally I at the time, Max Mercury, another speedster, took
	him under his wing. Bart's speedster name was given to him through having no concept of danger and doing things impulsively, hence his name
	Impulse. Later on, Bart goes on to join the Young Justice team, similar to the Teen Titans. Following the disappearance of Max Mercury, Bart
	was later taken in by Jay Garrick and his wife, while breaking off with Young Justice to be a part of the new line-up of the Teen Titans.</p>
